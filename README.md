# Clean-and-analyze-social-media
Clean and analyze social media usage data with Python

In this project, I embarked on a comprehensive analysis of social media usage data, starting from data generation to visualization and analysis. Importing necessary libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and random laid the foundation for data manipulation and visualization.

Random data generation was facilitated using Pandas' date range function, random choice for selecting categories, and NumPy's randint for generating random likes. This ensured a diverse dataset reflective of real-world scenarios.

Loading the data into a Pandas DataFrame enabled exploration and analysis. By examining the DataFrame head, information, and description, I gained insights into the structure and content of the data. Furthermore, counting the occurrences of each category shed light on the distribution of social media interactions.

Cleaning the data involved handling null values, removing duplicates, and converting data types to ensure consistency and accuracy in analysis. Utilizing Pandas' methods, I transformed date fields to datetime format and likes to integers, streamlining the dataset for visualization and statistical analysis.

Visualizing the data using Seaborn's histplot and boxplot functions provided intuitive representations of likes distribution across categories. Additionally, calculating the mean likes for each category via groupby operations offered valuable insights into user engagement patterns.

In conclusion, this project underscores the importance of data-driven decision-making in understanding social media dynamics. Through meticulous data handling and visualization, I provided actionable insights for optimizing content strategies and enhancing user engagement. The project's comprehensive approach and attention to detail set it apart, offering a robust framework for future business endeavors in social media analytics.
